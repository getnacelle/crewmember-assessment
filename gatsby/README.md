# React / Gatsby Crewmember Assessment

Welcome! Today's challenge: build out a storefront using some product data.

## Tasks:

### Part 1

#### In `src/pages/index.js

1. Make `productList` a separate component.
2. When you click on a product card, it is added to a cart / list of selected products.
3. Show the total value of the selected products.

### Part 2
 
Programmatically build a Product Detail Page for each product.

There aren't any styling requirements, but feel free to get creative!

### Bonus

Without altering `static/products.js`, make it so that any product only appears in the cart once, and show the product's quantity.
